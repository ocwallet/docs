## What is AUDIT?



_An audit is a systematic and independent examination of an organization's books, securities, accounts, legal records, documents, and coupons to determine how accurately and clearly a financial statement disclosure, as well as non-financial disclosures, have raised concern. It also tries to ensure that the books of accounts are properly maintained with the concern required by law. Auditing has become such a phenomenon in the public sector and everywhere else that academics are beginning to define a 'Society of Auditing'. The auditor perceives and recognizes the proposals before them for review, obtains evidence, evaluates the same, and forms an opinion based on his decision communicated in the audit report._

## Why is the AUDIT process important?



_Any subject can be audited. Inspection is a safeguarded measure since ancient times. Audits provide third-party assurance to various stakeholders that the matter is free from material misstatement. The term is most commonly applied to auditing financial information about a legal entity. Other areas generally audited include: secretarial and compliance auditing, internal controls, quality management, project management, water management and energy conservation._
