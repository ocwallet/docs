# AUDIT

![Company and Employee AUDIT report : https://github.com/interfinetwork/smart-contract-audits/blob/main/OCW\_AuditReport\_InterFi.pdf](<../.gitbook/assets/1415x475 - AUDIT.jpg>)

## What is AUDIT?



_Because smart contracts are immutable and cannot be_ **changed** _once deployed; code security needs to be_ **perfected** _before release. A single bug or vulnerability could misuse funds or give_ **hackers** _opportunities to exploit the contract._

__

_The biggest_ **hack** _in the_ **crypto world** _so far took place this August. Different tokens worth $600 million from_ **Poly Network**_, a cryptocurrency platform, were seized by a hacker. After a certain period of time, the_ **hacker** _returned these tokens and the platform users' grievances were resolved._

__

_However, this big event once again reminded all crypto users of the importance of using a_ **secure** _platform. So how can project owners and users know whether blockchain protocols and smart contracts are reliable enough? We may not have the technical knowledge to perform the necessary checks. This is where_ **Audit** _companies come into play._

## Why is the AUDIT process important?



**Security** _is a must in today's crypto world, especially with DeFi protocols_.



_If the protocol and smart contracts of the project you are using have been sufficiently audited and approved by the institution; you can use this project more comfortably, keep your money there and maybe sleep more comfortably at night._



_But we must not forget that no Audit firm, not even_ **CertiK**, _which is considered the best, can guarantee_ **100%** _absolute_ **security**. _Errors are_ **possible** _wherever there is a_ **human factor**. _This applies not only to the_ **crypto world**, _but also to today's traditional financial and centralized institutions._



_What CertiK and other Audit firms offer; It is to reduce these possible errors to the least possible level by making inspections._



_One of the ways to make a safe investment is to check whether the crypto platforms that you will invest in and use the opportunities they offer have these security audits and how well-equipped and sufficient the companies that carry out these audits are._
