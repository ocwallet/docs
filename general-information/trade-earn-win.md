**About early unlocking**: _Users can unlock and retrieve their tokens before expiration.

It may take **48-72 hours** for tokens to be credited to the account due to time zone differences._ If you want to cancel the advantage package before it expires, a **20%** deduction will be taken from your products. __&#x20;
