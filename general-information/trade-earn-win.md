About early unlocking: Users can unlock and retrieve their tokens before expiration. In case of early exchange and redemption, the principal is returned to the spot account and the distributed yield is deducted from the refunded principal. It may take 48-72 hours for tokens to be credited to the account due to time zone differences.
