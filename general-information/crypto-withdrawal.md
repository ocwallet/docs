**Computer**: _After creating a wallet through the previous article, head to the_ **Dasboard** _area, then you will see the list of other coins you have on the_ **Wallet Type** _chart, you can start the crypto money withdrawal process with the _**Withdraw** _button next to them._



**Mobile**: _These processes differ in the mobile application, as the mobile application steps differ, all you have to do is find the crypto asset list after heading to the Dashboard area. Since there is no button next to it compared to the computer version, you have to click on the crypto asset you want to withdraw._



**Note**: _Since the transactions are under the control of the management unit, the transactions may take up to 0-30 minutes. If you think your transaction has exceeded this time frame, contact us via our support line_.
