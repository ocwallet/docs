**Computer**: After creating a wallet through the previous article, head to the **Dasboard** area, then you will see the list of other coins you have on the **Wallet Type** chart, you can start the crypto money withdrawal process with the **Withdraw** button next to them.



**Mobile**: These processes differ in the mobile application, as the mobile application steps differ, all you have to do is find the crypto asset list after heading to the Dashboard area. Since there is no button next to it compared to the computer version, you have to click on the crypto asset you want to withdraw.
